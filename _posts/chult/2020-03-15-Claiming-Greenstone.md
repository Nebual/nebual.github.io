The crew awakens in the Tiefling's bar; Port-Town, Chult; rather bewildered
and confused about how they got there. Ken acquired full-body infernal tattoos,
with implications about a contract.
A [battered newspaper](/Capital-City-News/), and a letter with very curved
handwriting helped a little:

> Very good work! Happy to work with you again anytime!
> -- Abraxis, Archdevil

Our realtor finally got back to us with our _rather specific_ land requirements:
volcanic activity, active waterfall, remote setting, nearby arable land...
He'd come into contact with some _businessmen_ with a Mr Reinder hanging from a
meat hook, that they had a rather sizable debt from. Said individual owns a
delightful small village in a picturesque setting, and is _rather interested_
in selling! With the generous endowment of Lady Waverly backing us, we agreed to
whatever price they wanted, and signed a land deed transfer.

Arriving via our vessel, the Theseus, we find a rather mild welcoming in a
fairly simple town. The deposed mayor Reinder informs us his house, the only
two-story building in town, seems to have squatters living in it. A search
revealed a monk of the same Master as Hector Gavins, who explained that his
travelling group was working on a dig in the local mines.

> ## IT WAS ME, DIO!

Investigating them, we found a foreman (of the Monk's group) leading a number
of miners. Efforts at establishing communications were blunted by his rude
manner, and things came to blows. The foreman, shrugging off warning blasts,
proceeded to bite Rhyd's werewolf neck, and then jump off a waterfall - with no
splash! The miners seemed to be villagers from the town, so we put
most of them into a soft sleep, but they were surprisingly unwilling to parlay.
The foreman's dramatic return bit Misora as well, so while Ken was able to
dispatch him, the victory was concerningly lukewarm.
