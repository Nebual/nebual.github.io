The _Capital City Watch_ has now started to release information on _Pier
57_, the former site of a 20,000 ft<sup>2</sup> shipping warehouse owned by
the Mueller Trading Co. With the blaze finally subsiding after a gruelling 4 day
collaborative effort between the University and the Civic Dryads Association,
damage was narrowly restrained to the blocks affected by the initial energy
wave.

Top men are still piecing together exact timelines, using surviving witness
accounts and seismic readings from the Nuln Archeomagiservatory, and anyone
with additional credible information are encouraged to consult the Watch. As
the _Daily Mail_ previously reported, Pier 57 was being used by a cabal of
arcane tricksters, trafficking in highly unstable forbidden artifacts, many
of which continue to haunt the surrounding region. Trials of Gross Corruption
of Public Offices have been saturating the city's courts, with the Western
Light hospital (due to its proximity to the high court) being chosen to
house most of the survivors. 

### Publick Notices
* We've been informed the brass cylinders should be safe to remove once they
 fully cool; the Alchemists Society has offered generous rewards to anyone
  willing to deliver them still ripe.
* Professor Lawblei has certified that the _Brown Doll_ is harmless, and that
 proximity to it does not cause ill effects nor encourage it. He recommends
  ignoring it, which will cause it to eventually tire and move on.
* A donation pool has been established, to fund a bridge to reconnect Harbour
 and Government, as the _black tar_ has proven impossible to remove.
* Captain Who has been selected as the new Watch Commander, following the
 conclusion of the corruption trial of Cmdr Crichton.
* The Imperial Library is seeking the whereabouts of a pair of thieves,
 described as a female tiefling assisted by a _"Jacked" male human_
* The so called _Market Chicken_ has recovered from his feathery plight, and
 has requested to maintain anonymity.
* Lady Waverly has commissioned a new education establishment, said to become
 the jewel of the Far West, and formed the Waverly and Stone holding company
  to oversee its development.
