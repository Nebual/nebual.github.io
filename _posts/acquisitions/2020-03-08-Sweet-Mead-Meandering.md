Awaking from our brief reprieve, our party had shrunken - however, like in a
dream, our script stated we were not to worry for their fate, and trudged
onward without further concern.

Finding signs of our quarry's progress, we proceed through a collapsed tunnel
(those swine!), a vined passage full of necrotic thorns, and a pit full of
8000L of HCl. A further cavern assaulted us with spidered body sized cocoons,
culminating in a swift lance duel between the responsible aracnid and our
stalwart Lampert, finished off by a dark green blast from Smokey's smokey stone.

We meet Gork (of Gork n Mork) a cowardly (of course) goblin with long,
pointed fangs. He warns us of a creature lurking in the passages ahead, with
long, pointed fangs, that may have claimed his travelling companion. This
seemed a jovial moment to Go Fish n Chill for 8 hours to recoupe our luck.

Moving onward, we encounter a room 30 feet wide, with at least 30 feet in it.
Investigating the feet, Robbie picks up some feet from several feet away,
only to be assaulted by a troupe of animated feet - rising to his feet, he steps
several feet back, and then launches a multi-foot-long bolt, incredulously
skewering 3 pairs of feet. A stone Big Foot attempts to stomp Robbie, but he
gracefully steps 2 feet aside.
{: #feet}

> The little feet have a range of 5 feet.

Smokey launches a foot thick blast of verdant foot-blasting energy in an
attempt to cause smokey feet, to great effect. Robbie wraps the Big Foot in
30 feet of rope, successfully lassoing himself to it, but not effectively
slowing its movement by more than a few feet. From the several feet up vantage
point, atop the great Foot, he spots several footprint shaped runes, and
leaps towards the one fewer feet away. _Aligning foot to foot, it stops the
stomping of the Big Foot_, allowing our more dexterous feet to out footwork
the lesser feet.

> Something is afoot. -- Smokey

Continuing onto the H-Scene of the evening, we encounter a dark pool, from
whence a large \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ emerges, flailing wildly. Our cat caterwauls in
fear across a catwalk, blasting from above, as a pool of alchemists fire
flows across the methane surface of the pool, covering the writhing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_
in flames. 

> Sorry, you bit the poop tentacle??  
> I'm ok, I'm an animal.  
> Why is _this_ the thing you're really good at?!?

Splorp. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ squishes below the surface, defeated, for now.

Hearing a squawking ahead, several flying squid monsters, flying by some
horrid magickal means, are pecking at a trapped Brass Dragon wyrmling.
Rescuing her, she volunteers to accompany us, hoping to find a shorter and
less maniacally trapped route out.

Entering a large room, there's a broken solar system model nearby a dead dwarf,
an alter and an earthquake generating apparatus, and a standing sleeping guard.
She begins shrieking as she awakens, prompting Robbie to excel a Bondage roll,
and render her immobile, allowing us to calm the possessive spirits. With the
golden orrery in tow, we reverse traverse a dozen trap rooms to resurface
once more.
