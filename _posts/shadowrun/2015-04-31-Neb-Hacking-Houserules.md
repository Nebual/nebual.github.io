Hacking is primarily done via normal success tests, or occasionally opposed
tests, similar to other gameplay like dialogue or perception checks.

We avoid full VR Matrix simulation, in an effort to keep things interesting
for non-hacker characters.

List of computer related skills, their official description, and my effective purposes (house rules):

- Hacking - Use of exploits and subverting security systems
  - Used to discover military grade nodes
  - Used to gain access to military grade systems, including security doors
- Computer - General purpose computer literacy, poweruser skills, and knowledge
  - Used to discover civilian grade nodes
  - Used to gain access to civilian systems, including most commlinks and smart shoes
  - Used to operate and traverse complicated computer systems
- Data Search - Research ability, search engines, databases; tracking down info
  - Used to sift through large volumes of data to find useful tidbits
  - Used to Google things
- Electronic Warfare - Disrupting communications, signal degradation,
overtaking of comms
  - Used when dealing with jammers, either offensively or defensively
  - Used to encrypt and decrypt
- Cybertechnology - Creating and caring for cybernetics and bioware, including
repair
  - Used to repair cyberware and bioware
  - Used to identify cyberware and bioware, including potential vulnerabilities

###Looking for Nodes
State what you're looking for (smart weapons, surveillance equipment, drones,
etc) or that you're doing a general sweep, and then roll either Hacking or
Computers. You cannot discover more than Hits+1 nodes in a single scan, and
stealth nodes may require more hits.
