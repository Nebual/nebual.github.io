There was a job, given from a Mr. Johnson whose primary contact was at
the Lampshade Shop near the Burnside Industrial Zone: secure Fiona
from the residence she was being held at, in Tacoma.

Nathan, Rob, Nicolaj, and Michelle successfully broke in, extracted the girl,
and were on their way home when they were presumably captured, as their next
waking moment was in a K. E. holding cell. After breaking out with the help
of 2 additional runners who were caught with them, Neil and Thomas,
they climbed through a derelict watchtower to get over the main compound wall,
just as their prisoner transport chopper arrived.
They attempted a quick escape across town, but the chopper caught up with them.
Things looked grim for Our Heroes, when Thomas the mage threw an enormous fireball
at the chopper, effectively knocking him out but saving the team from
immediate rocket barrage.

In the resulting chaos, Nicolaj and Michelle fled, carrying Thomas.
Rob booked it through a startled gentleman's house, traversing backyards
and staying out of sight. Unfortunately for Neil,Nathan 'The Ronin' decided
to forgo escape and attack the chopper's Knight Errant SWAT team directly.
With a very well placed burst he annihilated the first assailant,
but by that point the chopper had recovered enough to fire a barrage,
decimating the gentleman's porch. Before blacking out,
Neil saw that the courageous Ronin had gone out in a blaze of glory.

Final States:

- Nicolaj: Unharmed, fleeing. Carrying a stolen document.
- Thomas: Terribly drained, carried by Nicolaj.
- Michelle: Unharmed, fleeing with Nicolaj.
- Nathan 'The Ronin': Presumed dead; captured by K.E.
- Neil: Mortally wounded; captured by K.E.
- Rob: Unharmed, fleeing in the opposite direction. Alone.

Karma will be awarded once you're safe.

We'll start next session by getting the existing crew to safety, and then potentially do a bit of roster shuffling.
