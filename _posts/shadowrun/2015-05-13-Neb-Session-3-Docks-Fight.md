Caught between the warehouse guards and Dock Security, Rambo lobs a flashbang
backwards as the crew of 4 runs for cover.

The grenade finds its mark,
disorienting the guards while our heroes planned their escape. Coming from
the van, Michelle and Rob surprised the security forces with pistols and
knives, while Sam and Nicolaj took swords to the occasion, covered by SMG
fire by Gears. With Dock Security quickly falling, the warehouse guards
attempted a frag grenade, which had great effect in the small quarters. Due
to his proximity, Nicolaj suffered the most from the explosion, with the rest
of the crew feeling a share of the pain. Sensing an opening, they fled the
scene carrying Nicolaj, but not before they had their retreating faces
photographed.

Sensing timeliness may be advisable, Michelle and Rambo headed straight for
the Lair of Mr. Mayor, intending to claim their reward for the retrieved
goggles. While he was quite glad to have them returned, his system was
unfortunately unable to identify their missing person, as they had nothing
but a blurry image and a fake SIN to track her by. They left with only a
business card and an I.O.U.

Meanwhile, the van was quickly stashed while the crew recovered. Nicolaj
received some much needed first aid from Rob, who forcibly persuaded Sam to
not fill Nicolaj's pericardial cavity with explosives. Looking through the
street CCTV footage, they spotted Fiona walking into the lobby of,
coincidentally, the Parkside Hotel.

Parking the van in the hotel's underground, they left Nicolaj to rest, while
they checked into the previously booked single room. Inevitably, the elevator
was hacked, revealing controls and a live camera feed. A quick Google search
revealed tourist videos of every floor of the building, none of which
contained any staff rooms, leading the team to suspect a hidden floor. A
perusal of the Elevator's remote admin controls granted access to a dark sub
basement, which Michelle and Rob opted to explore, while Rambo had an
expensive long distance phone call with his CO.

Exploring its offices, Rob located a discarded uniform, and donned the dirty
shirt. Narrowly dodging an actual staff member, they stumbled upon a
security fence armed with a maglock and a gas dispenser. After determining
that their maglock sequencer could not fool an RFID scanner, they realized a
confrontation with staff may be in order.

Rambo, getting off the phone, decided to explore other floors of the hotel.
Unbeknownst to Rambo, his arrival in the elevator was perfectly timed, as he
delayed the staff member's departure enough to allow Rob to log back into the
elevator and force it to descend. While Rambo calmed the attendant with a
concerned hug, Michelle set her pistol to stun. Upon the doors opening, the
man was tranquilized with a slap patch, silencing any complaints.

Finding naught but documents in his jacket, they dragged him to the security
fence, but his clearance was not enough to surpass the gate.
