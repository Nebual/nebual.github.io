Prince Renear explained his father was kicked out of office, having embezzeled a huge fortune, and then proceeded to hide his stash and wipe his own memory to prevent it falling into... the right hands? The _Stone of Golarrrrr_ is believed to hold the key to his memories and thus oodles of gold dragons.

Following the trail of the Kenku Drot spotted the previous night, we found a marked sewer grate. Peering into it, we do indeed see Zanathar gang tags - following them led us to a wooden ladder, guarded by a _thing with too many eye stalks._

> Really, any number of eye stalks is too many.

Dispatching the sewer mongrel, we climb to a large chamber, walls perforated with holes, from which gutteral yelling noises eminate. Goblins! With Teal's ~~gleaming armor~~ easily hit flesh providing cover, the group scurries past their ambush point, and runs into a camp belonging to the bandits previously harrassing our half-orc compatriot back in the bar. After a struggle, and some wild flailing into the air, the invisible giant dwarf was taken down.

With a forking path offering both slimey and non-slimey routes (we take the latter) - and find **_Floon Blagmaar_** under the boot of a half-orc, with a tentacled _Mindflayer_ onlooking, caressing a brain-dog. Upon seeing us, the 'flayer waves the half-orc onto us, and strolls out of the room _humming_.

A harrowing duel later, we opt for a hasty retreat to the daylight, through a secret passageway (leading through a halfling's brew cellar, of all places). _Volo_ is very pleased to see _Floon_ once more, though in place of his original offered payment (book royalties having not come to fruition), found himself forced to bequeath us a recent property acquisition: **_Trollskull Manor_**!

> And then Volo takes you all for ice cream and a tour of the city, for the rest of the day.
