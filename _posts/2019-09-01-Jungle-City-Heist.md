Our good old friend, Abraxis, came a knocking one day, and Crickets was all
too obliged to help him out, what with his soul being on the line and such.
The devil told us to go to the bank, early in the morning, with gear.

We were greeted at a side door by a quiet servant, who ushered us past
several layers of defences, to the center of the bank: its teleportation
circle chamber, with links back to Central Office way over in Capital City.
We were a little baffled, expecting a heist of some sort, but the servant
told us his instructions were merely to shuffle us over, along with a calling
card. While Serendipity wanted no part of this silly plot, she nonetheless
appeared beside Jeff on the far side.

Emerging into the bright safety of the Capital, we were assaulted by its
dazzling lights and street meats. Immediately a Sedan chair was chartered by
the great Hector Gavins, to elevate him past the petty squabbles of average
city folk, while the rest of us took public transit to Abraxis's contact.

Finally we were filled in to our actual endeavour: politically humiliate a
Bergermeister Mr. Mueller, in order to cause him to lose a significant military
contract to produce ships, so that they may be handled by an alternative
bidder from outside the city. We were joined by Ken Leaves, to assist us with
her "down to earth" connections. Given a generous down payment for sundries and
travel expenses, we split up to look for clues.

Flint and Jeff sought knowledge from the University, utilizing Flint's rather
dated library card to gain access. Flint learned he had family in the city.
Mueller's name came up in a few tabloids, which included scandalous rumours
about his daughter and a certain Prince of Nuln, along with the location of
his private estate.

Leaving the university, Flint ran into Trent Stone, who introduced himself as
Flint's Dentist brother, sent by their parents to look after the estranged
Flint. Flint, having no memories since the dip in the Peacockcrab Island pool,
had to take this at face value, but challenged his "brother" to a magic showoff.
Giant illusions abounded, each more preposterous than the last, until the
city guard intervened - demanding to see magic licenses. Flint managed to
fish something out of his many pockets that seemed to qualify, and got off
with a warning (along with some smirks about "invention magic").

Malick struggled to make inroads amongst his bretheren, the dwarven crafting
guilds of the city. He aimed to get hired by Mueller's designers, to gain
inside information.

> There's actually a lot of city dwarves, who are you, and why do you have so
> many horns?? _And __where__ did you get that belt??_

Crickets chatted up the local underground, leading to the purchase of
The Mueller Report, detailing his personal, corporate, and shadow lives.

#### The Mansion

Regrouping to break into Mueller's mansion, Ken and Jeff posed as gardeners
for a distraction, proceeding to demonstrate phenomenal topiaryship, to
produce the legendary Treecock "wedding gift" (as would then be depicted in
several highly circulated _Gardening Monthly_'s). 

Misora, disguised as a houseservant, snuck through the mansion and found
Mueller's office, discovering both the official books and _the books_,
revealing his upcoming schedule and the existence of The Auction.
Unfortunately, the safe proved too much for our thief, leading many to
wonder what further secrets Mueller was hiding.

Approaching a pre-auction meeting site, Jeff's little bird eavesdropped
discussion of some goods being sold for the auction, including a trick
sword cane, a case of Love Philters, and a peculiar Rubber Chicken Mueller was
very pleased about.

Seeing a potential way in, the party reviews their extensive list of cursed
and/or magical possessions, opting to pose as a scheduled supplier arriving
"early". We managed to offer away the cursed doll of returning, and
auditioned the trident of friendship draining; demonstrating by Hector
stabbing Malick, narrowly avoiding triggering his cursed axe revenge rage.
This earned us a position on the entry list.


#### The Auction

> Its not like you can just go to a _Magic Item Store_ and buy rings of power
> off the shelf. The taxes would be too high.

Approaching the auction, dressed in black hooded cloaks as was recommended,
the guards give us a thorough lookover, but conclude we're probably just some
lucky adventurer shoppers who've earned the favour of Mueller.
