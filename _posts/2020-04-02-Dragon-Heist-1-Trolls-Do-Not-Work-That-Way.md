Sitting around the vertically-challenged-folks table at the Yawning Portal
bar & grill, a motley assortment of halflings and dwarves discuss the city's
warnings of a potential upcoming quarantine. Several unsavoury types enter,
and are teaming up against a half-orc they have some quarrel with. We begin
assisting to improve her odds back to a fair fight, when a large troll
covered in nether-bats emerges from the gaping central portal, looking
mighty upset.

The Barkeeper leaps over his bar, branding a _very shiny blade_, and calls for
assistance dealing with the bats. Teal draws a rapier and proceeds to
~~elegantly run up the troll to stab~~ be crushed under a vicious troll blow.
Limping away feebly, a pair of netherbats (seeking blood) dive bomb him, but
are too distracted by his 'bling to find purchase. Vaulting the bar, Teal
finds the highest-proof bottle of grog, and hurls it directly at ~~the
troll's face~~ the table they started the night at, bursting into flames.
Undiscouraged, he grabs the lantern oil, and this time it - lights up the
floor closer to the troll. A third volley merely spreads the damage further.
But eventually the troll is overcomb by our numbers, and we rise victorious.

While cleaning up the damages, we're approached by a **Mr. Volo**, who is eager
to locate a wealthy drinking buddy of his, **Floon Blagmaar**, who seemed to have
not come home a few nights back. On the way to his last seen location, an
odd shop catches our eyes, filled with purple... antiquities of various forms
and functions - the proprietor seemed quite pleased with his collection, but
was light on many of the details.

After purchasing some violet gloves and an auberguine tankard, we enquired
about our prey, and heard someone was jumped by some thugs with similar
tattoos to those the half-orc quarrelled with. She was able to identify
the tattoos as the Zhentarim Cartel, and we entered a warehouse bearing their
mark - and a lot of bodies. After a very lengthy series of duels with the
remnants, we found a captive noble's son, who explained that he was kidnapped
alongside Floon. The Xanathar Collective were responsible for the second
'napping, and thought Floon the more valuable target, relocating him
elsewhere in their QUEST FOR THE STONE OF GOLARRR
